@par Example Description 
 
This example shows how to enters the system to STANDBY mode and wake-up from this
mode using external RESET or WKUP pin.

In the associated software, the system clock is set to 180 MHz, an EXTI line
is configured to generate an interrupt on falling edge and the SysTick is programmed
to generate an interrupt each 250 ms. In the SysTick interrupt handler, the LED1 is
toggled, this is used to indicate whether the MCU is in STANDBY or RUN mode.

When a falling edge is detected on the EXTI line an interrupt is generated. In the 
EXTI handler routine, the system enters STANDBY mode causing the LED1 to stop toggling.

A rising edge on WKUP pin or an external RESET will wake-up the system from
STANDBY.

After wake-up from STANDBY mode, program execution restarts in the same way as after
a RESET and LED1 restarts toggling.

Two leds LED1 and LED3 are used to monitor the system's state as following:
 - LED3 ON: configuration failed (system will go to an infinite loop)
 - LED1 toggling: system in RUN mode
 - LED1 OFF: system in STANDBY mode

These steps are repeated in an infinite loop.

@note To measure the current consumption in STANDBY mode, please refer to 
      @subpage PWR_CurrentConsumption example.

@note This example can not be used in DEBUG mode, this is due to the fact 
      that the Cortex-M4 core is no longer clocked during low power mode 
      so debugging features are disabled

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@note The connection of the LCD reset pin to a dedicated GPIO PK7 instead of the STM32F469 NRST pin may cause residual display on LCD with applications/examples that do not require display.
	  The LCD clear can be ensured by hardware through the board's power off/power on or by software calling the BSP_LCD_Reset() function.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F469xx/STM32F479xx devices.

  - This example has been tested and validated with STMicroelectronics STM32469I-EVAL revB 
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM32469I-EVAL Set-up
    - Use the Key push-button connected to pin PC13 (EXTI_Line13)
    - Use the Wake-Up button connected to pin PA00

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
